- [ ] transport pipeline with distance injection (more generally allow injecting weighted relations)
- [ ] transport optimal plan lengths (rerun due to converting to single agent)
- [ ] rerun optimal planner for non-blocksworld domains
- [ ] reintroduce cycle detection, seems to be an issue for Satellite
- [ ] min/max/quartile stats in plots

Blocksworld and Ferry experiments should be done
