- [ ] integrate to_jsons.py into the code to make it more robust
- [ ] redo satellite policy (see https://ipc2023-learning.github.io/talk.pdf)
- [ ] transport pipeline with distance injection (more generally allow injecting weighted relations)
- [ ] transport optimal plan lengths (rerun due to converting to single agent)

Blocksworld and Ferry experiments should be done
